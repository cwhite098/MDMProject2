Either run SIRSolve for the ODE solution or call modelNetworkFunction as follows

modelNetworkFunction(a,b, infectivePeriod, tf, n, I0, A)

where a and b are infection parameters, 
infectivePeriod is how long the disease lasts, 
tf is how long to run the model for (days),
n is the population size, 
I0 is the number of initially infected and 
A is an adjacency matrix.
